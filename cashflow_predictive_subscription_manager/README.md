# Autonomous Cashflow-Predictive Subscription Manager 6.0

This repository contains the implementation of the AI-powered system designed to manage SaaS subscriptions by predicting optimal pricing, churn risk, and customer lifetime value (CLV). The system forecasts cashflows, recommends personalized discount structures, and automates renewals based on predictive analytics.

## Architecture Overview
The system is composed of several key modules:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches subscription data from various sources.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleans and transforms raw data for analysis.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Implements machine learning models to predict churn risk, CLV, and cashflow forecasts.
4. **Decision Engine**: Uses predictions to determine optimal pricing and discount structures.
5. **Automation Module**: Handles subscription renewals and discount applications.
6. **Integration Layer**: Connects with external systems like payment gateways and CRM tools.
